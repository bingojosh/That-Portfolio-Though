            Josh is a young professional working in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Starting as a basic sales associate, Josh has taken every opportunity to better himself and enter the 
            world of web development. Starting with introductory courses to wordpress to help the small retail store he worked for better design their <a href="https:kbmoutdoors.ca" target="_blank">website</a>, he immediately
            dove head-first into all the semicolons and less-then/greater-thans he could find. With that first website ever a work in progress Josh then took on the larger
            <a href="https:kbm.ca" target="_blank">parent-company website</a> and began making changes to that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just one year later, Josh is the head of the company's small and growing 'web committee' and continues to strive to learn more and better the web presence of both
            the larger site and the smaller first one. Currently, he is in the process of taking KBMOutdoors' website into the realm of E-commerce, developing a catalogue,
            price list, integrated webstore and all the associated features.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to do all this in the most professional and efficient way, Josh has enrolled in the UofT SCS Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Seeking to deepen his knowledge,
             improve himself professionally, and better his mindset and experience personally, Josh will spend the coming months studying the ins and outs of html, css, javascript, and more
             and use that information in real time to improve the websites he works on.
